<div class="article">

<div class="sub-heading"><h3><p>As the City Council considers a package of bills that would crackdown on negligent landlords, most immediately hazardous class "C" housing violations in 2022 occurred in The Bronx, Upper Manhattan and Central Brooklyn.</p><p> The total number of class "C" violations has increased over the past decade and since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p></h3></div>

<p>The New York City Council is <a href="https://therealdeal.com/2022/12/07/citing-bronx-fire-council-pushes-building-violation-crackdown/">considering passing laws</a> that would crack down on the landlords of buildings with repeat hazardous apartment maintenance violations.</p>

<p>Citing a <a href="https://www.thecity.nyc/2022/6/13/23165323/faulty-self-closing-doors-twin-parks-fire-cited-inspectors">tragic Bronx fire</a> in January that killed seventeen residents and is believed to have been caused by the failure to maintain a self-closing door and insufficient heating, Council Members say bills that would <a href="https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=5555543&GUID=B94AD1D8-5470-4ADC-9E80-19A1681A7CE2&Options=&Search=">raise the penalty</a> for multiple violations to as high as $1000 are essential to keeping New Yorkers safe.</p>

<p>The Department of Housing Preservation and Development (HPD) maintains a <a href="https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Housing-Development/Housing-Maintenance-Code-Violations/wvxf-dwi5/data">database</a> with the total number of violations across the city. <a href="https://www.nyc.gov/site/hpd/services-and-information/penalties-and-fees.page">Class “C” violations</a> are classified as immediately hazardous, referring to anything from no heat or hot water, to a <a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/hpd/downloads/pdfs/services/jan-2022-maintenance-bulletin.pdf">faulty self-closing door</a> to lead-based paint. </p>

<p>This year, the most immediately hazardous violations through Dec. 17 were concentrated in Upper Manhattan, The Bronx and Central Brooklyn zip codes–in primarily low-income neighborhoods. The Flatbush zip code 11226 had the highest number with 8,137 violations, followed by 10458 in Fordham Manor with 6,347.</p>

<p>The zipcodes with the highest number of violations also appear consistent with the location of buildings cited in Public Advocate Jumaane Williams' <a href="https://www.landlordwatchlist.com/visuals">2022 "worst landlords" list</a>.</p> 

<p>Brianna McClure, a Harlem born-and-raised housing activist and member of Manhattan Community Board 10, noted the neighborhoods with the most violations “are majority brown and Black” and low-income. (<a href="https://popfactfinder.planning.nyc.gov/explorer/ntas/BK1401?acsTopics=demo-sexAndAge%2Cdemo-mutuallyExclusiveRaceHispanicOrigin%2Cdemo-hispanicSubgroup%2Cdemo-asianSubgroup%2Cecon-employmentStatus%2Cecon-commuteToWork%2Cecon-occupation%2Cecon-industry%2Cecon-classOfWorker%2Cecon-incomeAndBenefits%2Cecon-earnings%2Cecon-healthInsuranceCoverage%2Cecon-incomeInPast12MonthsIsBelowThePovertyLevel%2Cecon-ratioOfIncomeToPovertyLevel&censusTopics=all&source=acs-current">Flatbush</a>, for instance, is a majority-Black neighborhood.)</p>

<p>“There's still a lot of predatory landlords in these communities, which makes it very easy to not fix up conditions to the point where they become hazardous,” she said, describing the pattern as “structural racism.”</p>

<p>Added McClure, “if you live in deteriorating living conditions that has a severe impact on your physical health, your mental health, your ability to succeed at your job.”</p>
